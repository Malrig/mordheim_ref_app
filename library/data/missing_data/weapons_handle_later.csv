"Failed to parse special rules","Ball and Chain","Incredible Force: Because the Ball and Chain is so heavy, normal armour does very little to protect against it. No armour saves are allowed against wounds caused by a Ball and Chain. In addition, any hit from a Ball and Chain is very likely to take off someone's head (or at least break some ribs!). Therefore, any hit that successfully wounds will do 1D3 wounds instead of 1.Random: The only way to wield a Ball and Chain is to swing it around in large circles, using your body as a counter-weight. Unfortunately, this is not a very controllable fighting style, and as soon as he starts swinging his Ball and Chain, a warrior starts to lose control. The first turn he starts swinging the Ball and Chain, the model is moved 2D6"" in a direction nominated by the controlling player. In his subsequent Movement phases, roll a D6 to determine what the model does: -D6 Result: -• 1, The model trips and strangles himself with the chain. The model is taken out of action.

Opponents wishing to attack a Ball and Chain wielding model suffer a To Hit penalty of -1, as they must dodge the whirling ball to get close enough to strike. The Ball and Chain wielder cannot be held in close combat and will automatically move even if he starts the Movement phase in base contact with another model. If the model moves into contact with a building, wall, or other obstruction, he is automatically taken Out of Action.
