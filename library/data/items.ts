    name: "Banner", description: "A pirate warband may contain one pirate flag, chosen from the following. Carrying the banner takes up one hand though, so that model may not carry or use any two-handed weapons during the game. Note that Swabbies, lacking the true Pirate spirit, do not gain any benefit from the Pirate Banner. Good warbands (Sisters of Sigmar, Witch Hunters, Lothern Sea Patrol) may only use the ‘Nation's Colors' flag. \
 ● Jolly Roger: The personal crest of the pirate captain, personalized with cutlasses, curses against his enemies, and so forth. Jolly Roger (one per Warband) Any Hero may carry the Jolly Roger, the cost represents the effort to have the ship's sail makers create a smaller version that one man may carry on a long pole. Any Pirates within 12\" of the Jolly Roger never count as being All Alone in combat. Carrying the banner takes up one hand though, so that model may not carry or use any two-handed weapons during the game. Cost: 40+2D6gc (Pirates only)\
 ● 'Friendly' Flag or False Colours: The pirates fly the flag of a neutral country, normally Marienburg. This lulls merchant ships into a false sense of security (or, against other pirates, draws them in close to what they think is easy prey!) After set-up, your warband may advance an extra 6\" in. Unusable by High Elf Lothern Guard. 25+2D6gc\
 ● Hourglass: Any flag bearing the hourglass sends a clear message: your time is running out, surrender while you can. Roll D6+6. On the turn equal to that number, all opposing warbands who have suffered at least one notable casualty (eg. not Swabbies) are considered at Rout level. Cost: 50+2D6gc\
 ● Nation's Colors: So long as the Leader of the warband (or fail that, the current acting leader) is within 12\" of the Nation's Colors, he may automatically pass the first Rout Check he is required to take. The next turn, the model may ignore route check on a roll of 4+. Next turn, the rout check may be ignored on a roll of 6+. None of these dice may be rerolled by any means. If the Leader is carrying a Holy Relic and a the first Leadership test he is required to take is a rout check, the Nation's Color and Holy Relic are both exhausted at the same time (though the Nation's Color may ignore the next test on 4+, and then 6+ as normal.) Note that a flag with the Nation's Colors is the only type of flag that Navy Warbands can field. Leader Cost: 40+2D6gc\

If the result is higher than the Toughness of the model taking the test, he will suffer an automatic wound. A result of 6 always inflicts a wound. Models of undead and possessed never take this test. The Quarantine Flag may only be taken by Carnival of Chaos and by Skaven Pestilans members. Cost: 30+2D6gc\
 ● Red Flag: The Red flag is the most feared of all, for it meant No Quarter, and no one left alive. All the members in your warband within 6” of the banner cause fear.

 ● Wagon: The Engine of Chaos follows all rules for Wagons (see Empire in Flames Supplement, p. 30-33) unless specified otherwise here.\
 ● Daemon: The Engine of Chaos is powered by the binding of a daemon. All references to draft animals pulling the Wagon should be treated as referring to its daemon. Daemon movement is unaffected by cargo [so is a base 6” wagon movement]. \
 ● Passengers: A Chaos Dwarf must function as the driver. No other models but captives may passage the Engine of Chaos. No more than six captives may be imprisoned in the Engine at a time - large creatures (Ogres, Minotaurs, etc.) count as two models. \
 ● Pedal to the Metal: The driver may “apply the lash.” If an Engine of Chaos goes out of control then refer to the Out of Control table.

 ● Prisoners: Models always become captives when fighting a battle against a Chaos Dwarf warband that has an Engine of Chaos by rolling the Captured result on the Serious Injuries table or by being taken out of action by a Man-catcher. Note that in both cases their equipment is lost to the Chaos Dwarf warband. Some results on the Mordheim Exploration chart let Chaos Dwarfs acquire captives: Straggler (one) and Prisoners (D3). From the Empire in Flames Exploration chart: Raving Lunatic (one), Lost Children (two), Mordheim\
 Refugees (D3), The Hanging Tree (one), Small Farm and Large Farm (two). Models held as captives can be set free by destroying the Engine of Chaos or by using the prison keys. If a model puts one of the Chaos Dwarf warband's Gaolers out of action they take the keys. A model that takes the keys may free the captives by moving into base contact with the engine. If the Chaos Dwarfs rout before this happens or if the model with the keys is taken out of action (losing the keys to a new keeper), the captives remain captured. Freed captives must always move towards the closest table edge. Captives not from participating warbands use the basic profile for human warriors (see Mercenary warband).

Sometimes a magical link will develop between one of these animals and the wizard, to the extent that the wizard begins to see through the animal's eyes, and hear its thoughts. Wizards in different lands favor different types of familiars, depending on their environment: Shadow Weavers tend to favor darkly-colored animals that can blend into the shadows with them easily- ravens or darkly-colored cats are most common. Regardless of their form, familiars are actually not normal members of their kind at all, but rather creatures that have somehow become attuned to the Winds of Magic. Familiars cannot actually be purchased as normal equipment. The cost to ‘purchase' a familiar actually represents the cost of materials to cast the ritual to summon a familiar and form a magical bond with it, the Rarity level represents the chances of the ritual actually working. As such, the cost of the familiar must always be paid if the rarity roll is attempted, regardless of the success of the roll. Also, only spell-casters can attempt to ‘find' a familiar. If a familiar is found, it should be modeled on the Spellcaster as with any other piece of equipment. A familiar may be placed on a separate base (in fact many of the familiars that GW sells come this way, but if this is done the familiar must always remain in base-to-base contact with the wizard, and it is ignored for game purposes (so it may not attack enemy models or be attacked itself, may not intercept attackers, does not increase the wizard's base size, etc.), other than the effect below.

A unit's colors can hold a lot of meaning, particularly when the warriors in that unit lack a true home. A Shadow Warrior band normally makes their standard by hand, cost and rarity represent the difficulty of finding the proper materials (fine silks and thread of gold, for example). A Standard of Nagarythe can serve as a second rallying point (the Shadow Master is the first, represented by his Leader skill) for the unit. Any members of the Shadow Warrior Warband within 6\" of their standard take all Leadership tests against a Leadership value of 10. In addition, should the standard be captured by the enemy (model holding the standard is Taken Out of Action), all members of the Warband will be subject to Frenzy for the remainder of the game, and may not voluntarily Rout. Note that these effects (Leadership 10 and Frenzy) do not affect any Hired Swords in the Warband, only actual Shadow Warriors (including Shadow Warrior heroes) are affected. A model carrying a standard requires one hand free to do so, so no weapons, shields, etc. may be carried in this hand, and no double-handed weapons may be used while the standard is carried. A standard may be used in close combat as a makeshift spear (use the rules for a spear but with -1 on the to hit rolls.)", availability: { rarity: 9, restrictions: ["Shadow Warrior warbands only"] }, price: "75 + 3D6", favourite: false, source: "", source_type: SourceStatus.Unknown },
