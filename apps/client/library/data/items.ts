    description: "A pirate warband may contain one pirate flag, chosen from the following. Carrying the banner takes up one hand though, so that model may not carry or use any two-handed weapons during the game. Note that Swabbies, lacking the true Pirate spirit, do not gain any benefit from the Pirate Banner. Good warbands (Sisters of Sigmar, Witch Hunters, Lothern Sea Patrol) may only use the ‘Nation's Colors' flag. \n ● Jolly Roger: The personal crest of the pirate captain, personalized with cutlasses, curses against his enemies, and so forth. Jolly Roger (one per Warband) Any Hero may carry the Jolly Roger, the cost represents the effort to have the ship's sail makers create a smaller version that one man may carry on a long pole. Any Pirates within 12\" of the Jolly Roger never count as being All Alone in combat. Carrying the banner takes up one hand though, so that model may not carry or use any two-handed weapons during the game. Cost: 40+2D6gc (Pirates only)\n ● 'Friendly' Flag or False Colours: The pirates fly the flag of a neutral country, normally Marienburg. This lulls merchant ships into a false sense of security (or, against other pirates, draws them in close to what they think is easy prey!) After set-up, your warband may advance an extra 6\" in. Unusable by High Elf Lothern Guard. 25+2D6gc\n ● Hourglass: Any flag bearing the hourglass sends a clear message: your time is running out, surrender while you can. Roll D6+6. On the turn equal to that number, all opposing warbands who have suffered at least one notable casualty (eg. not Swabbies) are considered at Rout level. Cost: 50+2D6gc\n ● Nation's Colors: So long as the Leader of the warband (or fail that, the current acting leader) is within 12\" of the Nation's Colors, he may automatically pass the first Rout Check he is required to take. The next turn, the model may ignore route check on a roll of 4+. Next turn, the rout check may be ignored on a roll of 6+. None of these dice may be rerolled by any means. If the Leader is carrying a Holy Relic and a the first Leadership test he is required to take is a rout check, the Nation's Color and Holy Relic are both exhausted at the same time (though the Nation's Color may ignore the next test on 4+, and then 6+ as normal.) Note that a flag with the Nation's Colors is the only type of flag that Navy Warbands can field. Leader Cost: 40+2D6gc\n ● Quarantine Flag: When an enemy model takes the flag bearer out of action in hand to hand combat, the model who inflicted the injury must take a Toughness test. Roll a D6. If the result is higher than the Toughness of the model taking the test, he will suffer an automatic wound. A result of 6 always inflicts a wound. Models of undead and possessed never take this test. The Quarantine Flag may only be taken by Carnival of Chaos and by Skaven Pestilans members. Cost: 30+2D6gc\n ● Red Flag: The Red flag is the most feared of all, for it meant No Quarter, and no one left alive. All the members in your warband within 6” of the banner cause fear. It can only be flown by a warband that can take Prisoners. Any game in which you bring the Red Flag, you may not take any prisoners afterwards. Cost: 40+2D6gc",

You can only poison a single weapon with one vial of poison.\n Crimson Shade is the name given by Old Worlders to the leaves of the blood oak of Estalia.

Crimson Shade has no effect on Undead such as Vampires and Zombies, or the Possessed.\n ● Side Effects: After the battle, roll 2D6. On a roll of 2-3, the model becomes addicted and you must try to buy him a new batch of Crimson Shade before every battle from now on. If you fail to buy any, he will leave your warband.

All references to draft animals pulling the Wagon should be treated as referring to its daemon. Daemon movement is unaffected by cargo [so is a base 6” wagon movement]. \n ● Passengers: A Chaos Dwarf must function as the driver. No other models but captives may passage the Engine of Chaos. No more than six captives may be imprisoned in the Engine at a time - large creatures (Ogres, Minotaurs, etc.) count as two models. \n ● Pedal to the Metal: The driver may “apply the lash.” If an Engine of Chaos goes out of control then refer to the Out of Control table. In the event of rolling the result ‘Loss of Control', replace a result of 5 (The wagon yoke pole snaps...) with: The Daemon has released itself from the sorcery which bound it to the Engine of Chaos. The Engine moves 6\" straight ahead and then comes to a halt. The vehicle may no longer move for the remainder of this battle.\n ● Prisoners: Models always become captives when fighting a battle against a Chaos Dwarf warband that has an Engine of Chaos by rolling the Captured result on the Serious Injuries table or by being taken out of action by a Man-catcher. Note that in both cases their equipment is lost to the Chaos Dwarf warband. Some results on the Mordheim Exploration chart let Chaos Dwarfs acquire captives: Straggler (one) and Prisoners (D3). From the Empire in Flames Exploration chart: Raving Lunatic (one), Lost Children (two), Mordheim\n Refugees (D3), The Hanging Tree (one), Small Farm and Large Farm (two). Models held as captives can be set free by destroying the Engine of Chaos or by using the prison keys. If a model puts one of the Chaos Dwarf warband's Gaolers out of action they take the keys. A model that takes the keys may free the captives by moving into base contact with the engine. If the Chaos Dwarfs rout before this happens or if the model with the keys is taken out of action (losing the keys to a new keeper), the captives remain captured. Freed captives must always move towards the closest table edge. Captives not from participating warbands use the basic profile for human warriors (see Mercenary warband). Rescued captives return to their former warbands. \n ● Hashut's Reward: The Chaos Dwarfs may choose to send captives back to the Dark Lands after a battle. If they do this, any number of captives must be sacrificed to Hashut. The Engine of Chaos plus one Hero must miss the next battle. Unless there is another engine, no models may be captured until they return. Captives must be removed from their warbands rosters permanently. After the Hero rejoins the warband consult the following table. \n Captives                Hashut's Reward\n 1-3                 +1 Experience points for the leader.\n 4-5                 +D3 Experience points which can be distributed among the Heroes.\n 6                 +2D3 Experience points which can be distributed among the Heroes plus D6x5 gc.",

    description: "Wizards are often solitary, usually shunned by those who can barely conceive of, much less understand, the power these individuals wield. As such, they often share their lives with animal companions, rather than more ‘sentient' beings. Sometimes a magical link will develop between one of these animals and the wizard, to the extent that the wizard begins to see through the animal's eyes, and hear its thoughts. Wizards in different lands favor different types of familiars, depending on their environment: Shadow Weavers tend to favor darkly-colored animals that can blend into the shadows with them easily- ravens or darkly-colored cats are most common. Regardless of their form, familiars are actually not normal members of their kind at all, but rather creatures that have somehow become attuned to the Winds of Magic. Familiars cannot actually be purchased as normal equipment. The cost to ‘purchase' a familiar actually represents the cost of materials to cast the ritual to summon a familiar and form a magical bond with it, the Rarity level represents the chances of the ritual actually working. As such, the cost of the familiar must always be paid if the rarity roll is attempted, regardless of the success of the roll. Also, only spell-casters can attempt to ‘find' a familiar. If a familiar is found, it should be modeled on the Spellcaster as with any other piece of equipment. A familiar may be placed on a separate base (in fact many of the familiars that GW sells come this way, but if this is done the familiar must always remain in base-to-base contact with the wizard, and it is ignored for game purposes (so it may not attack enemy models or be attacked itself, may not intercept attackers, does not increase the wizard's base size, etc.), other than the effect below. A wizard with a familiar is allowed to re-roll one failed roll to cast a spell each turn. The result of this re-roll must be accepted, even if it fails, and remember that you may never re-roll a re-roll. Spell-users only (does not include users of Prayers). Note that unlike many of the items above, this item is equipment that any warband with a spell-user may use, if he can summon it successfully.\n ● Special Rules: The cost of the familiar must always be paid if the rarity role is attempted, regardless of the success of the roll.

Your opponent may automatically choose the next scenario you play.\n 2-3 Vague: Though crude, the map is generally accurate (well… parts of it are… perhaps!). You may re-roll any one dice during the next exploration phase if you wish but you must accept the result of the second roll.\n 4   Catacomb Map: The map shows a way through the catacombs into the city. You may automatically choose the scenario next time you fight a battle.\n 5   Accurate: The map is recently made and very detailed. You may re-roll up to three dice during the next exploration phase if you wish. You must accept the result of the second roll.\n 6   Master Map: This is one of the twelve master maps of Mordheim made for Count von Steinhardt of Ostermark. From now on you may always re-roll one dice when rolling on the Exploration chart as long as the Hero who possesses this map was not taken out of action in the battle.",

One is a barrel of Bugman's XXXX, which can be used as per the rules for Bugman's Ale. After ‘sampling' many of the other barrels, the remainders are sold off for 2D6x10 gold crowns (after the crew wakes up, of course). \n         4. Buried deep in the ruins of an unassuming hovel you find several chests filled with fine clothes, plus several notebooks outlining blackmail information for many of the local trading merchants.

Armed with your new clothing and information, on your next visit to the trading posts you may buy any one item listed on the regular Price Chart as if it was Common (except any other Pirate Warband unique items, such as Swivel Guns or Treasure Maps), assuming you have the money. Once the transaction is complete, you turn around and sell the notebooks to his competitors for 2D6x10 gold crowns, and make any other trading post purchases as normal. Also, if in your next game your warband captures anyone, or finds any Stragglers or Prisoners, the fine clothing impresses them quite a bit! The Captain's Leadership is increased by +1 when testing to see if any join your warband.\n         5. The treasure chest that is found has been carefully booby-trapped! One of your Heroes must try to penetrate the maze of poisoned dart-shooters and collapsing pathways that surround the chest by passing an Initiative test. If he passes, his expert approach reveals a Lucky Charm near the chest (which he claims for himself!), and 3D6x10 gold crowns in the chest itself. If he fails the test, he must sit out the next game as he recovers, but the crew do manage to open the chest now that the traps have been set off and gain the gold as above.

Your crew bow their heads in reverent silence, as the map has lead them to one of the legendary secret burial spots used by Black-Wyrd the Pirate King, first and finest pirate to ever ravage Mordheim. Known for tying shards of Wyrdstone into the thick strands of his hair and beard and then setting them alight so they set off sparks of unholy fire, he was rightly feared by all Warbands throughout the land and sea.

One of the products of this love of life and celebration is a strong alcoholic spirit called vodka. It is also one of the country's most famous exports, though most inhabitants of the Old World find it too harsh for their palates. Kislevites take such enjoyment in this drink and regard it as something almost magical. Mothers give vodka to their families to ward off sickness and to keep them warm in the long winter months and warriors indulge both for luck and courage. Outsiders often scoff at the reputed properties of this liquor, but it must be said that a Kislevite army that is well supplied with vodka certainly fights better and in higher spirits than one without. In game terms, vodka is a one-use item of equipment that a Kislevite Hero may give to the warband before the start of the game. Every warrior in the warband receives +1 Leadership (up to a maximum of 10) for that game.

    description: "Grappling Hooks are designed to be thrown or projected a distance, where its hooks will engage with the target. Grappling hooks were originally used in naval warfare to catch the rigging of an enemy ship so that it could be drawn in and boarded. A Grappling Gun is a transportable Grappling Hook launcher that uses gunpowder or springs to create pressure that fires the hook in the direction of the target. Once it has hit, there's another mechanism that allows the shooter to retract the hook (more often than not this results in the shooter moving towards what the Hook has dug into). Brought to Mordheim by pirates seeking their fortunes, these Grappling Guns have now made it to the black markets of the city. They offer their owners a cruel way to kill their enemies and a means to scale the highest of buildings incredibly fast. \nRange: 8\": Strength 4: Special Rules:\n● Prepare shot: A Grappling Gun takes a complete turn to reload, so your model may only fire every other turn. \n● No Long Range: A Grappling Gun ignores penalties for Long Range. \n● Climb: Any model equipped with a Grappling Gun can use the Grappling Hook for climbing and add +1 to his Initiative when making Climbing tests. Up, up and away!: In a turn where a model takes a regular move (ie. not running or charging) and as long as the Grappling Gun is loaded, a model equipped with a Grappling Gun can fire it at a piece of terrain within the 8\" range of the weapon. Take an unmodified BS-test (a '6' always fails) to see if the Grappling Hook has hit the intended target and caught on. If it has, move your model to whatever the target was. If the target was halfway up a wall, and you wish to climb the rest of the way using normal climbing movement, make an Initiative test as normal, but without the +1 for using the Grappling Hook (as that's stuck in the wall). Failing this will, of course, result in falling damage as usual.",

Covered with crusted salt, alcohol and other less savory materials, toughened leather is hard to penetrate and offers some protection in combat.\n ● Special Rule: Toughened leathers work exactly like light armor, giving the wearer a 6+ Armor save, but cannot be combined with the effects of any other armor except a helmet or buckler. Toughened leathers cannot be sold back at the Trading Posts, the stench alone is enough to drive away even the most desperate of buyers!",

They offer a good degree of protection to the face and head without weighing the wearer down. A model that is equipped with a plague mask has a special 5+ save against being stunned.  If the save is successful, treat the stunned result as knocked down instead.  This save is not modified by the opponent's strength",
