"Unknown rarity","Black Lotus","Not available to Witch Hunters, Warrior-Priests or Sisters of Sigmar.
The use of poison is almost universally abhorred, but in the ruthless and brutal battles fought in Mordheim, desperate warbands often resort to the use of envenomed blades. Poison may not be used with Blackpowder weapons. When you buy a vial of poison, there is always only enough to last the duration of one battle. You can only poison a single weapon with one vial of poison. In the deepest forests of the Southlands grows a plant that is extremely poisonous. It is known as Black Lotus and is much sought after by alchemists, assassins, wizards of the Western Coast and bored wives. A weapon coated with the sap of the Black Lotus will wound its target automatically if you roll a 6 to hit. Note that you can still roll a dice for every wound inflicted in this way. If you roll a 6, you will inflict a critical hit with that roll. If you do not roll a 6, you will cause a normal wound. Take armor saves as normal.","Rare 9, Rare 7 for Skaven and Saurus, Common for Skinks at 10gc","","10+D6","","","",""
"Unknown rarity","Blessed Water or Holy Water","May not be bought by Undead.
The priests of Ulric, Sigmar, Morr and Manann hold great power over evil. Pure water from a clear fountain, blessed by one of these priests, is said to burn things of darkness and evil. A vial of blessed water contains enough liquid for just one use, and has a thrown range of twice the thrower's Strength in inches. Roll to hit using the model's BS. No modifiers for range or moving apply. Blessed water causes 1 wound on Undead, Daemon or Possessed models automatically. There is no armor save. Undead or Possessed models may not use blessed water.","Rare 6, Common (Warrior-Priests & Sisters of Sigmar)","","10+3D6","","","",""
"Unknown rarity","Dark Venom","Not available to Witch Hunters, Warrior-Priests, or Sisters of Sigmar
The use of poison is almost universally abhorred, but in the ruthless and brutal battles fought in Mordheim, desperate warbands often resort to the use of envenomed blades. Poison may not be used with Blackpowder weapons. When you buy a vial of poison, there is always only enough to last the duration of one battle. You can only poison a single weapon with one vial of poison.
This is a poison extracted from Heldrakes, gigantic sea serpents that plague the Western Ocean and the coast of Naggaroth. The slightest wound infected by Dark Venom causes excruciating pain, incapacitating the bravest of men. Any hit caused by a weapon coated with Dark Venom counts as having +1 Strength, so, for example, if a warrior with Strength 3 wielding a poisoned sword hits an opponent, he will cause a Strength 4 hit instead. Armor saving throws are modified to take into account the increased Strength of the attack.","Rare 8, Rare 6 for Dark Elves and Saurus, Common for Skinks at 20gc","","30+2D6","","","",""
"Unknown rarity","Gnoblar, Claimed","Ogres find simple pleasure in the bickering of Gnoblars and some claim one as their pet for amusement. An astute Gnoblar puts his malice to good use and places the right action at the perfect moment to gain itself a master. Treat these Gnoblars in all aspects like miscellaneous equipment (they are not models and do not occupy their own bases!). However, if the Ogre owning them was taken out of action in a game, roll a D6 for each of his Gnoblars: on a 1-2 they are dead and removed from their master's equipment. Ogres may own up to two different Claimed Gnoblars. These can be represented on the model they accompany. 
● lookout-gnoblar: 20 gc: Availability: Rare 8 (Ogres only) 
An Ogre with a Lookout-Gnoblar gains the skill Dodge from the Speed skill list.
● luck-gnoblar: 25 gc: Availability: Rare 9 (Ogres only) 
An Ogre with a Luck-Gnoblar may re-roll one dice during the battle. Remember you may never re-roll a re-roll. 
● sword-gnoblar: 30 gc: Availability: Rare 10 (Ogres only) 
An Ogre with a Sword-Gnoblar gains one extra Strength 2 attack in Close Combat, at the weapon skill of the owning model. This attack is made at the same time as the owning Hero's attacks and must be directed at a model the Ogre has directed attacks toward. The opponent's attention is on the Ogre!","Rarity varies","Ogre warband only","cost varies","","","",""
"Unknown rarity","Grappling Gun","Grappling Hooks are designed to be thrown or projected a distance, where its hooks will engage with the target. Grappling hooks were originally used in naval warfare to catch the rigging of an enemy ship so that it could be drawn in and boarded. A Grappling Gun is a transportable Grappling Hook launcher that uses gunpowder or springs to create pressure that fires the hook in the direction of the target. Once it has hit, there's another mechanism that allows the shooter to retract the hook (more often than not this results in the shooter moving towards what the Hook has dug into). Brought to Mordheim by pirates seeking their fortunes, these Grappling Guns have now made it to the black markets of the city. They offer their owners a cruel way to kill their enemies and a means to scale the highest of buildings incredibly fast. 
Range: 8\": Strength 4: Special Rules:
● Prepare shot: A Grappling Gun takes a complete turn to reload, so your model may only fire every other turn. 
● No Long Range: A Grappling Gun ignores penalties for Long Range. 
● Climb: Any model equipped with a Grappling Gun can use the Grappling Hook for climbing and add +1 to his Initiative when making Climbing tests. Up, up and away!: In a turn where a model takes a regular move (ie. not running or charging) and as long as the Grappling Gun is loaded, a model equipped with a Grappling Gun can fire it at a piece of terrain within the 8\" range of the weapon. Take an unmodified BS-test (a '6' always fails) to see if the Grappling Hook has hit the intended target and caught on. If it has, move your model to whatever the target was. If the target was halfway up a wall, and you wish to climb the rest of the way using normal climbing movement, make an Initiative test as normal, but without the +1 for using the Grappling Hook (as that's stuck in the wall). Failing this will, of course, result in falling damage as usual.","Rare 10, Rare 8 for (Pirate warbands)","","40+ 2D6","","","",""
"Unknown rarity","Holy (Unholy) Relic","In this age of superstition and religious fanaticism, holy objects are an important part of life. Relics abound in the Old World: hairs of Sigmar, pieces from Ulric's hammer, teeth of Daemon Princes, all are sold to men needing encouragement before battle and as charms against sorcery. A model with a holy relic will automatically pass the first Leadership test he is required to make in the game. If worn by the leader, it will allow him to automatically pass the first Rout test if he has not taken any Leadership tests before. You can only ignore the first Leadership test in any single game - owning two or more holy relics will not allow you to ignore second and subsequent tests.","Rare 8, Rare 6 for Warrior-Priests & Sisters of Sigmar","","15+3D6","","","",""
"Unknown rarity","Hook Hand","Fighters who have lost a hand or arm due to a Hand Injury or Arm Wound can be fitted with a sharpened metal hook. The wearer of the stylish new device cannot use any two-handed weapons, but will always count as having a close combat weapon in that hand. The hook strikes in close combat in the same manner as a dagger. A new pirate joining the warband, either during initial warband creation or as a new hire, may also start out with a Hook Hand. If the wearer gets a Hand Injury or Arm Wound in further battles, these can be ignored on a roll of 4+ as the hit was taken by the Hook Hand instead.","Common  (one per model)","","4","","","",""
"Unknown rarity","Shoppe","A shoppe was basically a two story house, with the ground level used to sell things. Many soldiers came across a lot of valuable items that they did not pass on to the church of Sigmar and set up stores in the towns they resided in. I have petitioned our Grand Theogonist to send inquisitors after the descendants of those who robbed our church of what was rightfully ours. Your warband must own a house before buying a shoppe. They now sell used equipment for 75% of its original cost [înstead of 50%]. They will also gain a sporadic income from the things you manage to sell, so add 2D6 gold crowns to  their treasury after every game.","Rare 8 (Upgrade to House)","","60+2D6","","","",""
"Unknown rarity","Temple","The lives of those who built temples to Sigmar were constantly filled with a steady stream of worshippers to their doors. Because of this they were constantly reminded of their duties and could not stray from the light. Your warband may only build a temple if they already own a house. Their prayers will be answered more readily by the gods so a warrior casting a Divine Intervention [Prayers of Sigmar] will gain +1 to the attempt [casting roll]. Also, a steady stream of followers will seek to aid them in battle against evil. Your leader gains the Good Shepherd ability. This works in much the same way as the Children of the Horned Rat spell, though replace the rats with D3 hammer-wielding zealots from the Witch hunter warband list.","Rare 10 (Upgrade to House)","","150+25xD6","","","",""
"Unknown rarity","Hunter's Cloak","This cloak is fashioned by Kislevites and only worn by their rangers.  A hidden ranger will not reveal her position by shooting.  The target model can take an Initiative Test to try and spot the firing ranger.  If the Test is successful, the ranger is no longer hidden.","not available (Kislev Ranger Hired Sword only)","","not available","","","",""
"Unknown rarity","Ladder","Ladders are useful for reaching higher ground such as scaling walls or trees. A ladder is placed on the board like any other model. If you have no adequate model, use a marker to represent the ladder. A Ladder requires two models, Heroes or Henchmen, (or a single large model) to carry it. However, one model can carry a ladder alone, but may then move at half speed only (quarter for large ladders). Models carrying a ladder may not run. They may drop the ladder any time they wish (e.g. when charged). A ladder may be set up in the Movement phase in base contact with any of the carriers. This requires a quarter of their Movement (half for large ladders). Note that if one of the models has a lower Movement than the other, both models are slowed down while carrying the ladder. Ladders are considered open ground and do not affect the model's movement rate (see Mordheim Rulebook). Any model in base contact with a ladder may try to knock it over in the hand-to-hand combat phase. The model must pass a Strength test with a -1 modifier for every model on the ladder after the first. If the test is successful treat the models as falling from where they were. Small ladders have a length of up to 3\", large ladders are longer than 3\".","Common small / Rare 5 large","","5  small / 10  large","","","",""
"Unknown rarity","Peg Leg","Any Pirate suffering a Leg Wound or Smashed Leg can opt to have his ruined leg replaced with a stout wooden peg leg. This will reduce his Movement (and maximum possible Movement characteristic) by -1, but offers a chance that stray hits will strike the leg instead. This gives him a special saving throw of 6+, which can be taken whenever he fails any other saving throws allowed against any wounding shooting or hand-to-hand hits. This save is not modified, and can be used even if no saving throw is normally allowed. A new pirate joining the warband, either during initial warband creation or as a new hire, may also start out with a Peg Leg. If the wearer gets a Leg Wound or Smashed Leg in further battles, these can be ignored on a roll of 4+ as the hit was taken by the Peg Leg instead.","Common  (one per model)","","8","","","",""
"Unknown rarity","Warpstone Tokens","The Warlock Engineers have a developed a way of refining shards of wyrdstone into tokens that can fuel their spells. By trading in a piece of treasure to Skaven merchants, the warband gains D3 warpstone tokens. 
Warpstone boost: A skaven wizard can consume one warpstone token before he casts a spell. He gains +1 to his rolls to see if he can cast spells successfully that turn and may consume more than one for a cumulative effect. If the wizard rolls doubles when using a warpstone token he will be taken out of action as the raw power is too much for his mind to handle.","Special","Skyre Skaven warbands only","1 piece of treasure or wyrdstone shard","","","",""
